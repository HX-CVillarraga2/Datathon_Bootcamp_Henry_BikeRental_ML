This notebook summarize a 4-day machine learing datathon (aka hackathon) as part of the data science bootcamp I .... at Henry (https://www.soyhenry.com/carrera-data-science)

<b>The problem</b>:

"We" are part of the Rent-Cycle team in Washington DC, and our Team Leader gives us the task of implementing a model that allows us to predict the number of bicycles that are rented based on the information contained in the dataset made available.
We need to use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a metric to evaluate our model!
